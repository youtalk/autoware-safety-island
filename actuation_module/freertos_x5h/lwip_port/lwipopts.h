// Review finding (Important #2, fix round 1): a first draft left this at 64
// and sized TCPIP_MBOX_SIZE/DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE to 64 each on the
// claim that "64 is the largest value either mailbox can usefully take,
// since the pool is 64" -- true in isolation, false once

// simultaneous demand on the pool is TCPIP_MBOX_SIZE(64) + up to
// 3 * DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE(64) + IP_REASS_MAX_PBUFS(24) = 280 pbufs
// against a pool of only 64, so the pool -- not either mailbox depth --
// silently caps effective burst absorption well below the "64" the old
// comment implied, to roughly 40 pbufs by the review's estimate.
// Doubled to 128 rather than just correcting the comment: the cost is small

// Task 21's item 1 (CONFIG_DDS_MAX_MSG_SIZE/FRAGMENT_SIZE=434/348) makes

// IP_REASS_MAX_PBUFS = MEMP_NUM_REASSDATA * 3 = 24 follows directly from

// absorbs far more datagrams per burst than before." That is wrong for
// TCPIP_MBOX_SIZE and backwards for DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE; corrected
// below. The 32 -> 64 raise itself was directionally right and is
// unchanged; only the reasoning was.
//
// rpmsg_poll_task (priority 5, this file's TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO + 1) strictly
// preempts tcpip_thread (priority 4) -- see rpmsg_transport.c's own
// priority-map comment. (CORRECTED: this used to attribute that preemption
// to configUSE_TIME_SLICING == 0, which is the wrong reason for a right
// claim. A strictly higher-priority runnable task preempts a lower one
// under configUSE_PREEMPTION == 1 alone; time slicing has nothing to do
// with it, and only ever governs EQUAL-priority tasks. The sizing
// conclusion below is unaffected.) So whatever the poll task drains from
// the vring and pushes into
// TCPIP_MBOX in one pass -- from the moment it wakes until its own
// vTaskDelay(1) -- tcpip_thread gets zero chance to drain any of it; the
// mailbox has to be able to hold that whole pass by itself.
//
// Before Task 21, common/dds/config.hpp's CONFIG_DDS_MAX_MSG_SIZE override
// (1400 B, unchanged by that macro's own default) meant almost every
// full-size DDS datagram IP-fragmented into ~4 pieces on this 434 B UDP
// payload (462 MTU - 20 IPv4 - 8 UDP): "eight datagrams inside one tick"
// was already enough 4-frame datagrams to fill the old TCPIP_MBOX_SIZE=32
// exactly -- a zero-margin fit, not a deliberately chosen target, and
// exactly what Task 18's board run saw (rx_drop_input_err climbing to 841
// during a single DDS discovery burst while the mailbox stayed full).
//
// TCPIP_MBOX_SIZE holds one entry per LINK FRAME, not per DDS datagram:
// glue_rx_deliver() (rpmsg_netif.c) does one `pbuf_alloc(PBUF_RAW, len,
// PBUF_POOL)` per inbound RPMsg message and hands it straight to
// netif->input(), which is what queues into TCPIP_MBOX -- before IP
// reassembly, before UDP demux. Item 1 (CONFIG_DDS_MAX_MSG_SIZE/
// FRAGMENT_SIZE=434/348) does not change how many link frames a given
// sample costs: the total bytes on the wire for a sample are roughly the
// same either way, and this link's per-frame payload capacity (~434 B) is
// unchanged, so the total frame count a sample needs is roughly conserved
// regardless of whether CycloneDDS internally slices it into one big
// IP-fragmented UDP datagram or several small RTPS-fragmented ones -- the
// brief's own Fact 1 established exactly this (a 1400 B payload costs the
// same ~4 link frames whoever splits it). So item 1 relieves close to zero
// TCPIP_MBOX pressure; it is the reassembly-loss fix (item 1's real job),
// not a mailbox-pressure fix.
//
// DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE goes the OTHER way under item 1, and by more
// than a little: before, a large sample (e.g. Trajectory ~908 B, Odometry
// ~724 B -- exactly the Linux->CR52 traffic behind the no_firstcontact
// failure this task exists to fix) arrived as its IP fragments got
// silently reassembled by lwIP into ONE complete UDP datagram before ever
// reaching the socket layer, so it cost few DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX entries
// (one per RTPS-level fragment CycloneDDS itself used, not per IP
// fragment). After item 1, each RTPS fragment IS its own complete,
// unfragmented UDP datagram (see common/dds/config.hpp's derivation: a
// single fragment now fits under the IP MTU on its own), so it is
// delivered to the socket recvmbox directly, with NO IP reassembly step to
// coalesce it with its siblings first -- a sample that used to need N
// small reassembly buffers behind ~1 recvmbox entry now needs N separate
// recvmbox entries instead. Trajectory (~908 B / 348 B-per-fragment = 3
// fragments) roughly triples its DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX demand versus the
// pre-Task-21 shape.
//
// Both mailboxes are raised to 64 anyway, and 64 is still the right number
// -- but for a different reason than "absorbs more datagrams per burst":
// PBUF_POOL_SIZE (above, raised to 128 in the same fix round -- see that
// macro's own comment for why 64 was already an under-sized shared ceiling
// once DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE's newly-higher real demand is counted) is
// the actual system-wide ceiling on pbufs in flight across TCPIP_MBOX,
// every UDP recvmbox, and IP_REASS_MAX_PBUFS combined; a single mailbox
// depth cannot productively exceed what that shared pool can back, and 64
// remains the largest depth either mailbox can request without first
// contending against the pool's other consumers on paper (they still
// contend in practice -- see PBUF_POOL_SIZE's comment -- raising the
// mailbox depth further would not change that). RAM cost: this port's
// sys_mbox_new() (lwip_port/sys_arch.c) backs each mailbox with a FreeRTOS
// queue of `void *`, i.e. one 4-byte pointer per slot on this 32-bit
// Cortex-R52 target -- (64-32) * 4 B = 128 B for TCPIP_MBOX_SIZE, and up to
// another 128 B per UDP PCB for DEFAULT_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE (this file's own
// MEMP_NUM_UDP_PCB comment above puts real usage at ~3 sockets, i.e. ~384 B
// there in practice, with a worst-case ceiling of 8 * 128 B = 1024 B if
// every possible PCB were opened). These queues are allocated via
// pvPortMalloc() (rcar_bsp's heap_useNewlib.c), which serves newlib's own
// [HeapBase, HeapLimit) heap region -- NOT this file's MEM_SIZE (256 KiB),
// which is lwIP's own separate internal heap for pbufs/PCBs/etc. Both are
// carved out of the same 10 MiB Core1 slot at link time either way, so the
// "negligible against the 10 MiB slot" conclusion is unaffected; only the
// specific pool named was wrong.
//
// For this choice to be wrong: a burst would have to sustain, for longer
// than tcpip_thread needs to drain 64 queued entries (each drain is one
// UDP/IP receive-processing pass, not itself rate-limited by anything on
// this link), a production rate high enough to refill the mailbox faster
// than that drain -- at which point no finite mailbox depth fixes it and
// the real fix would be elsewhere (e.g. throttling discovery traffic
// itself), not a bigger number here.

// ---- Thread priorities (review finding, Important #1) ----
//
// Previously unset here, so both TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO and DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIO
// silently took lwIP's own lwip/opt.h default of 1 -- the exact priority
// FreeRTOS gives every DDS/controller pthread on this port (tskIDLE_
// PRIORITY + 1; see include/platform/freertos/x5h/pthread.h). Tying the
// tcpip thread to the same priority as the DDS/controller pthreads is a
// real hazard and the raise below is right, but state WHY correctly.
//
// CORRECTED: this paragraph used to argue that "FreeRTOS never round-robins
// ready tasks of equal priority ... a ready task only yields to an
// equal-priority peer when it blocks or calls taskYIELD()", and concluded
// that whichever task the scheduler picked "could hold the CPU
// indefinitely". Only the first clause is true, and only as far as it goes:
// configUSE_TIME_SLICING == 0 removes the TICK-driven switch
// (rcar_bsp/FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c:4810-4841) and nothing else. Task
// selection still runs listGET_OWNER_OF_NEXT_ENTRY (tasks.c:178-193 on this
// build, which has configUSE_PORT_OPTIMISED_TASK_SELECTION == 0), so the
// ready list rotates on EVERY context switch -- including the ones caused
// by a higher-priority task becoming ready or blocking again, which on this
// port happens constantly. So equal-priority tasks do interleave, and an
// equal-priority tie costs a peer roughly half the CPU rather than all of
// it. The full derivation, with the kernel's own wording, is in
// freertos_main.cpp's ACTUATION_TASK_PRIORITY block; it is not repeated
// here.
//
// The raise is unaffected by that correction, because what it buys comes
// from STRICT priority, not from time slicing: at 4 the tcpip thread
// preempts every application task outright and runs whenever it has work,
// which is the property this file needs. Halving its CPU against a
// CPU-bound peer would already be unacceptable for RX delivery; being
// preempted by one would be worse. Neither is possible at 4.
//
// This target's real priority map (see rpmsg_transport.c's own comment on
// the poll task priority for the full picture and how it was verified):
//   31  rpmsg_vdev_hb    (transient, deleted after vdev bring-up)
//    5  rpmsg_poll_task  (TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO + 1, this file's own transport)
//    4  tcpip_thread     (TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO, set here)
//    3  FreeRTOS timer service (configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY, vendor-fixed)
//    2  actuation_task   (ACTUATION_TASK_PRIORITY, freertos_main.cpp) --
//       and every CycloneDDS ddsrt thread with it, since those inherit the
//       priority of the task that creates them (the Controller constructor,
//       on actuation_task) rather than pthread.h's
//    1  the controller's own pthread and anything else pthread.h creates
//       (tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1, see that file)
//
// CORRECTED (this replaces a line of this very map that a later board
// session found to be false): the entry above actuation_task's used to read
// "30  actuation_task (blocked forever in pthread_join once startup runs)".
// The parenthetical is what let a 30 sit above the whole network stack
// unchallenged through a review, and it is the reason the actuation image
// never transmitted a frame. actuation_task does block in pthread_join --
// eventually, at src/main.cpp:57 -- but it first runs configure_network()
// and the entire Controller constructor (CycloneDDS participant + Eigen MPC)
// without blocking, and a runnable task is never preempted by a STRICTLY
// LOWER-priority one. (That is plain priority under configUSE_PREEMPTION;
// the original wording credited configUSE_TIME_SLICING == 0, which governs
// only equal priorities and is not what made a 30 fatal here.) So for that
// whole stretch the
// tcpip thread at 4 and the poll task at 5 simply did not run: the channel
// was announced and then nothing was ever transmitted, while Linux logged
// its virtio_rpmsg send path timing out waiting for the remote to return a
// tx buffer. "It blocks eventually" was never the property this map needed;
// "it cannot hold the CPU while the network must run" is, and the launcher
// now sits at 2 with a compile-time assertion in freertos_main.cpp holding
// it below both network tasks. Note also that TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO's own job
// grew as a result: at 4 it is above the DDS threads whether they land at 1
// (pthread.h) or 2 (inherited from the launcher).
//
// TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO=4: strictly above every task that runs application code
// -- the controller/DDS pthreads at 1, the CycloneDDS ddsrt threads and the
// actuation launcher at 2 -- so the tcpip thread cannot be starved or even
// merely delayed by any of them. Strictly above, not merely different: at
// EQUAL priority it would round-robin with a CPU-bound peer and get about
// half the CPU, which is already too little for RX delivery. The margin
// here comes from priority alone and needs no time-slicing argument.
// DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIO=(TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO + 1): mirrors
// freertos_s32z2/include/.../lwipopts.h's own DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIO-above-
// TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO placement (there, DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIO is where NXP's
// eth_port.c RX-poll thread actually runs). Nothing in this lwIP tree
// spawns a thread at DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIO today (SNMP, its only in-tree
// consumer, is not built here), so this is currently unused, defence-in-
// depth sizing -- but it is derived from, not independent of,
// TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO, so it cannot silently drift back to lwIP's own
// default-1 if TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO is ever changed here without a matching
// edit. The value happens to equal RPMSG_POLL_TASK_PRIORITY (5): both
// represent "one priority level above the tcpip thread, for whatever
// services this netif's I/O promptly," so sharing the number is
// intentional, not a coincidence to be tidied away.
//
// Scoped to this project's own concern only -- whether the controller
// pthread itself (priority 1) should instead be raised above the tcpip
// thread is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE here: that pthread is spawned via
// include/platform/freertos/x5h/pthread.h's pthread_create(), a POSIX-
// compat shim shared with other platforms, and repricing it is a separate,
// larger change this lwipopts.h fix does not make. What this fix guarantees
// is only that the tcpip thread -- and therefore RX delivery into it -- is
// never starved by the application tasks below it. It guarantees nothing
// about tasks placed ABOVE it: holding the actuation launcher below this
// value is freertos_main.cpp's static_assert, not this file's, because the
// value that can drift is the launcher's.
