// rewritten from, the vendor BSP's own rpmsg sample
// (rcar_bsp/.../sample_apps/rpmsg_sample/rpmsg-echo.c, BSD-3-Clause,
// (c) 2025 Renesas Electronics Corporation): platform_init() ->
// platform_create_rpmsg_vdev() -> rpmsg_create_ept(), then a task-context
// poll loop calling platform_poll(). Two differences from that sample, both
// called out in the task brief: the endpoint's service name is
// RPMSG_ETH_SERVICE ("rpmsg-eth"), not "rpmsg-client-sample", and the rx
// callback forwards each message to rpmsg_netif_rx() (rpmsg_netif.h)
// instead of echoing it back. A third, structural difference: the sample's
// echoTask() does setup (platform_init/vdev/endpoint) and the poll loop in
// the same FreeRTOS task; here setup runs synchronously inside
// rpmsg_transport_init() (called from lwip_bring_up_blocking(), see
// lwip_bringup.c), and only the poll loop gets its own dedicated task -- see
// that task's own stack-sizing comment below for why this split matters.

// defines its LPRINTF as `printf(...); vTaskDelay(10);`
// (rcar_bsp/.../sample_apps/rpmsg_sample/rpmsg-echo.c and its siblings) and

// configTICK_RATE_HZ of 1000 -- unconditional stall on two paths that must
// not stall:
//
//   - rpmsg_poll_task, via rpmsg_netif_print_stats_if_changed() below. The
//     poll loop is the only thing draining the vrings, and its own pacing is
//     a deliberate vTaskDelay(1); a stats line turned that into 11 ms with
//     nothing servicing inbound frames.
//   - ept_unbind(), which runs inside platform_poll()'s OpenAMP name-service
//     callback, i.e. also on rpmsg_poll_task and also mid-virtqueue-
//     processing.
//
// Dropping the delay costs nothing, because it was never load-bearing for
// console integrity on this board: printf reaches the BSP's own _write()
// (drivers/serial/serial.c) -> outbyte() -> console_putc() ->
// uart_rcar_poll_out() (drivers/serial/scif.c), which busy-waits on

// port never calls. The one caller whose cadence could have depended on the
// delay, rpmsg_vdev_heartbeat_task() below, paces itself with an explicit
// vTaskDelay(RPMSG_VDEV_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD_TICKS) and, if anything, now reports
// its elapsed seconds slightly more accurately.

// ---- remote unbind -- review finding (cross-repo, final round) ----
//
// The Linux side tore down its endpoint. That is a routine event, not a
// terminal one: besides module unload, reboot and crash, it now covers the
// ordinary case of the Linux rpmsg-eth daemon exiting and being restarted.
// That daemon deliberately exits non-zero when its endpoint stops making
// write progress, so that its service manager restarts it and it rebinds --
// its only recovery from a wedged link. The Linux rpmsg stack announces
// both halves of that over name service: a DESTROY when the endpoint goes
// away, and a CREATE when the restarted daemon binds again.
//
// Note the asymmetry in what can be checked from here, because this block
// exists to stop exactly that kind of claim from passing unmarked. The
// DESTROY half is verified below -- it is what invokes this callback at
// all. The CREATE half is a statement about the LINUX side's behaviour and
// is NOT readable from this tree: everything below establishes only that
// IF a CREATE arrives, this port now handles it. Step 4 of the board
// checklist -- the link returning with no CR52 reset -- is what actually
// tests that half.
//
// CORRECTED (this replaces a stated invariant a later review found false --
// the same convention, and for the same reason, as the two priority blocks
// further down): this function used to end with rpmsg_destroy_ept(&s_ept),
// justified as "there is no reconnect protocol on this link, so a
// subsequent rpmsg_transport_send() will simply fail rather than silently
// going nowhere". Both halves were wrong. OpenAMP's name service does have
// a reconnect path; destroying the endpoint is precisely what put this port
// out of reach of it, converting a transient outage into a permanent one
// recoverable only by resetting the CR52 -- on this board, a full SoC
// reboot. The old comment even argued, two sentences before that call, that
// rpmsg_poll_task must keep serving "a future re-bind after Linux reloads
// its driver" -- the exact outcome the call on its own next line made
// impossible. That paragraph is kept, further down, now that it holds.
//
// What the vendored OpenAMP actually does -- read in this tree (open-amp
// 2024.10.0), not assumed, since a false premise in a comment block is what
// cost this branch a board session already. lib/rpmsg/rpmsg_virtio.c,
// rpmsg_virtio_ns_callback():
//
//   - RPMSG_NS_DESTROY (:671): it resets our endpoint's dest_addr to
//     RPMSG_ADDR_ANY (:673) and only then calls ns_unbind_cb (:677-678),
//     i.e. this function. So on entry here the endpoint is already in
//     exactly the state rpmsg_create_ept() leaves a fresh one in -- this
//     file creates s_ept with dest == RPMSG_ADDR_ANY (see below).
//   - A later NS CREATE looks the endpoint up via
//     rpmsg_get_endpoint(rdev, name, RPMSG_ADDR_ANY, dest) (:663), and
//     lib/rpmsg/rpmsg.c:283-284 has a clause for this exact case ("ept is
//     registered but not associated to remote ept"): the name matches
//     RPMSG_ETH_SERVICE and dest_addr is RPMSG_ADDR_ANY, so the surviving
//     endpoint is returned and :698 sets dest_addr = dest. The link is back
//     with no action from this file.
//   - Destroying it forecloses that. rpmsg_destroy_ept() (rpmsg.c:379-392)
//     calls rpmsg_unregister_endpoint() (rpmsg.c:289-300), whose
//     metal_list_del(&ept->node) (rpmsg.c:297) unlinks s_ept from
//     rdev->endpoints, so the lookup returns NULL, the NS CREATE takes the
//     `if (!_ept)` branch (rpmsg_virtio.c:687), and the only recovery left
//     there is rdev->ns_bind_cb -- NULL in this port, because
//     rpmsg_transport_init() passes NULL, NULL to
//     platform_create_rpmsg_vdev(). The CREATE is silently dropped.
//
// Keeping the endpoint is therefore neither a leak nor a stale-state
// hazard: nothing is allocated per bind (s_ept is file-scope storage and
// its local address stays reserved in rdev's bitmap, which is what we
// want), and dest_addr -- the only per-peer field -- has already been
// cleared by OpenAMP before we run. It is what makes rebinding possible at
// all.
//
// Two things re-latch the endpoint, both already in the vendored code: the
// NS CREATE above, and the first inbound frame (rpmsg_virtio.c:592-598 sets
// dest_addr from the frame's src whenever it is RPMSG_ADDR_ANY). Inbound
// delivery survives the gap because that path resolves the endpoint by our
// LOCAL address (rpmsg_get_ept_from_addr(), :586), which never changes.
//
// Between unbind and re-bind, rpmsg_transport_send() is a clean bounded
// failure rather than a hazard: rpmsg_trysend() (rpmsg.h:275) passes
// ept->dest_addr as the destination, and rpmsg_send_offchannel_raw()
// (rpmsg.c:126) rejects dst == RPMSG_ADDR_ANY with RPMSG_ERR_PARAM (-2003)
// before touching a vring. rpmsg_transport_send() maps that to -1;
// rpmsg_netif_core_tx() counts tx_err++ and returns -2
// (rpmsg_netif_core.c:14-15); rpmsg_netif_linkoutput()'s switch turns that
// into ERR_IF on its `default:` arm (rpmsg_netif.c:122), and lwIP drops
// that one frame -- the same outcome as a full tx ring, with no blocking
// and no access to released state. That tx_err climb is what distinguishes
// this window on the console from the priority-starvation defect it
// otherwise resembles: here rpmsg_poll_task is running, so the periodic
// stats line below keeps printing with tx_err rising; under starvation the
// poll task itself never ran, so no stats line appeared at all.
//
// Dropping the destroy also drops a hazard it carried: rpmsg_destroy_ept()
// announces an NS DESTROY of its own (rpmsg.c:388-390) through
// rpmsg_send_ns_message(), which uses wait=true -- OpenAMP's blocking tx
// path, up to RPMSG_TICK_COUNT/RPMSG_TICKS_PER_INTERVAL == 15000 rounds of
// metal_sleep_usec(1000), i.e. 15 s, when the ring is full
// (rpmsg_virtio.c:376-400; see rpmsg_transport_send()'s own comment for why
// this path is avoided there too). That ran on rpmsg_poll_task, inside
// platform_poll(), to announce a teardown to a peer that had just announced
// its own -- and a peer that has stopped draining the tx ring is exactly
// the condition under which that wait runs to its full length.
//
// Unlike the vendor sample's rpmsg_service_unbind() (which sets a
// shutdown_req flag that its own task loop polls and then exits to an idle
// spin), this port has no equivalent "stop everything" state to enter:
// rpmsg_poll_task must keep calling platform_poll() regardless, since
// MFIS/virtqueue-level traffic -- the re-bind above included -- is
// channel-level, independent of any one endpoint's lifetime. That was
// already the intent; the code now matches it.
//
// Not covered by any host test, and it cannot be: exercising this needs a
// real NS DESTROY/CREATE pair from a Linux peer, which no build or gate in
// this repository can produce. The board session is the only evidence --
// restart the Linux daemon and the link must come back on its own.

// has a documented multi-session incident (a `tev` thread sleeping under
// LOCK_TCPIP_CORE starved tcpip_thread into a deadlock) that makes "equal to
// tcpip_thread" a priority worth justifying, not assuming safe.
//
// CORRECTED (a later review found the closing claim below false, the same
// convention this file already uses for the two priority blocks further
// down): this comment used to say rpmsg_trysend() here "never touches a lock
// tcpip_thread needs". That is wrong. rpmsg_trysend() acquires rdev->lock
// twice -- inside rpmsg_virtio_get_tx_payload_buffer() (rpmsg_virtio.c:383)
// and again inside rpmsg_virtio_send_offchannel_nocopy() (:448) -- and
// tcpip_thread's own tx path needs that SAME lock, via
// rpmsg_transport_send() below calling rpmsg_trysend() too. LOCK_TCPIP_CORE
// (lwIP's own lock, taken in lwip_bringup.c/rpmsg_netif.c's tx path) and
// rdev->lock (OpenAMP's internal mutex) are two different locks; the old
// clause about lwIP's core lock was true on its own narrow terms but let a
// reader miss that a different lock IS shared here, which is the one that
// actually matters for this pair of tasks.
//
// It is still safe, for three reasons this port's configuration gives us --
// not because no lock is involved:
//   1. With wait=false, rpmsg_virtio_get_tx_payload_buffer() sets
//      tick_count = 0 (rpmsg_virtio.c:376-379) and its retry loop breaks
//      after one attempt (:386) without ever reaching the
//      metal_sleep_usec() at :395. So this task never sleeps while holding
//      rdev->lock -- the hold is one non-blocking attempt, then release.
//   2. Nothing in this tree uses the blocking wait=true path
//      (rpmsg_transport_send()'s own comment below, rpmsg_transport.c:
//      763-764, records that same choice for the eth channel), so
//      rdev->lock is never held across a multi-second wait by any caller in
//      this image.
//   3. libmetal's __metal_mutex_init() backs rdev->lock with
//      xSemaphoreCreateMutex() (freertos/mutex.h:41), which carries
//      FreeRTOS priority inheritance. si_hb and tcpip_thread sit at equal
//      priority (see above), so the only contention this pair can produce
//      is one task briefly waiting for the other's bounded, non-sleeping
//      critical section -- not a priority inversion, and not a deadlock.
// So a full second of this task's own execution is one non-blocking send of
// a few dozen bytes, holding rdev->lock only across that one bounded
// attempt; there is nothing on this path that can hold the CPU, or that
// lock, away from tcpip_thread for longer than that one send takes. Equal
// priority is therefore only a scheduling-fairness question (round-robin
// between si_hb and tcpip_thread when both are runnable), not a starvation
// or deadlock one. If a future change adds a blocking call (wait=true) or a
// longer critical section to this task, all three reasons above need
// re-checking, not just re-asserting.

// Why the wire can stay quiet for a while after boot, restored here because
// it explains something an operator will actually see: rpmsg_create_ept()
// leaves s_si_ept.dest_addr at RPMSG_ADDR_ANY until Linux's rpmsg-si driver
// sends this endpoint something (same mechanism ept_unbind()'s comment
// block above documents for s_ept, and it applies again after any later
// unbind). rpmsg_send_offchannel_raw() (rpmsg.c:126) rejects
// dst == RPMSG_ADDR_ANY with RPMSG_ERR_PARAM before touching a vring, so
// every heartbeat sent before Linux binds fails at that guard. This task
// ignores rpmsg_trysend()'s return value (see the `if (n > 0)` below, which
// only checks the FORMAT result), so that failure is deliberately unlogged.
// This paragraph is what tells a board-session operator why the first N

#define RPMSG_POLL_TASK_STACK_WORDS (configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE * 2)

// ---- poll task priority -- review findings (Important #1 of an earlier
// whole-branch round; then corrected a second time after the Stage 3 board
// session found the priority map this block asserts was itself wrong) ----
//
// CORRECTED, ROUND 1 (this replaced a stated invariant that a later
// whole-branch review found to be false): the original comment claimed the
// poll task sat "strictly BELOW actuation_task (configMAX_PRIORITIES - 2 ==
// 30): the controller must always win CPU contention." That reasoning
// treated actuation_task's own priority (30) as if it were the controller's
// priority. It is not: the controller's real work -- the MPC/PID loop --
// runs on a pthread spawned by include/platform/freertos/x5h/pthread.h's
// pthread_create(), which hardcodes tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1 (== 1) with no way
// to override it from this file.
//
// CORRECTED, ROUND 2 (this round -- the same block, wrong again for a
// different reason, and this time it cost a board session): round 1 went on
// to claim that actuation_task "blocks forever in pthread_join once
// started", and concluded from that the second bound below "buys nothing
// today". Both halves were false in the way that mattered. actuation_task
// does reach pthread_join (Controller::wait_for_completion(),
// src/main.cpp:57) -- but only after running configure_network() AND the
// entire Controller constructor, CycloneDDS participant creation plus Eigen
// MPC construction, at priority 30, above every network task in this image.
// Nothing below 30 can preempt a task that has not yet blocked, so for that
// whole stretch neither this poll task (5) nor the tcpip thread (4) ran at
// all. (CORRECTED: this used to credit that to configUSE_TIME_SLICING == 0.
// It is plain strict priority under configUSE_PREEMPTION == 1 -- a runnable
// task is never preempted by a lower-priority one whatever time slicing
// says. configUSE_TIME_SLICING governs EQUAL priorities only, and even
// there it removes only the tick-driven switch, not the round-robin; see
// freertos_main.cpp's ACTUATION_TASK_PRIORITY block for the kernel
// citations. The diagnosis in this paragraph is unaffected: 30 was above
// the network tasks, which is a strict-priority problem.) The board showed
// exactly that: the
// rpmsg-eth channel announced itself (so rpmsg_transport_init() below had
// run to completion) and then transmitted nothing -- inbound frames counted
// up on the Linux side, outbound stayed
// at zero, ARP never resolved, and the Linux side logged its virtio_rpmsg
// send path giving up waiting for the remote to return a tx buffer, on a
// 15 s cadence. The netif_only_x5h image, on the identical transport, link
// and MTU but with its launcher at tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1, had a clean
// symmetric link -- which is what isolated the launcher's priority as the
// entire delta between the two builds.
//
// "It blocks in pthread_join" was true and was still the wrong test. The
// test is whether it holds the CPU while the network has work to do, and
// everything before src/main.cpp:57 does. freertos_main.cpp now launches it
// at ACTUATION_TASK_PRIORITY (tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 2 == 2) and asserts the
// ordering at compile time rather than describing it; see that file for why
// 2 and not 1 or 3. The corrected map, against rcar_bsp's own
// FreeRTOSConfig.h (configMAX_PRIORITIES 32, configUSE_PREEMPTION 1,
// configUSE_TIME_SLICING 0, configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY 3):
//
//   31  rpmsg_vdev_hb        (transient, deleted after vdev bring-up)
//    5  rpmsg_poll_task      (this task -- TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO + 1)
//    4  tcpip_thread         (TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO, set in lwipopts.h)
//    3  FreeRTOS timer service (configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY, vendor-fixed)
//    2  actuation_task       (ACTUATION_TASK_PRIORITY, freertos_main.cpp)
//       -- and with it every CycloneDDS ddsrt thread, which inherit this
//       priority rather than pthread.h's: ddsrt's FreeRTOS threads.c takes
//       the CALLING task's priority whenever attr->schedPriority is 0 (the
//       default nothing in ddsi overrides), and they are created inside the
//       Controller constructor, i.e. on actuation_task
//    1  the controller's own pthread, and anything else pthread.h creates
//       (tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1, hardcoded there)
//
// Chosen value here is unchanged, TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO + 1; what moved is its
// definition, now in rpmsg_transport.h so freertos_main.cpp's assertions and
// this file's xTaskCreate() cannot disagree. Both bounds, restated as the
// properties that actually hold:
//   - Strictly ABOVE TCPIP_THREAD_PRIO: the poll task's only real-time job
//     is draining MFIS/virtqueue notifications promptly so rx frames reach
//     tcpip_input()'s mailbox with low latency; delivery into that mailbox
//     is itself non-blocking (sys_mbox_trypost(), see the stack comment
//     above), so raising this task above the tcpip thread cannot starve the
//     tcpip thread of CPU -- it only ever preempts it for the short, bounded
//     duration of one platform_poll()/ept_cb() pass, then blocks again on
//     vTaskDelay(1).
//   - Strictly ABOVE everything that runs application code: the launcher at
//     2, the CycloneDDS threads that inherit its priority, and the pthreads
//     at 1. This bound REPLACES, and inverts, round 1's "strictly BELOW
//     actuation_task (30)" -- after this change the poll task sits above the
//     launcher, and that is the point, not an accident of renumbering. The
//     property is not "the controller must win CPU contention" (it never
//     was); it is that the two tasks which actually move frames -- this one
//     and the tcpip thread -- must always be able to preempt whatever the
//     application is doing, including a startup path that runs for a long
//     time without blocking. Losing that does not produce a slow link, it
//     produces a link that never transmits at all. The half of this bound
//     that can realistically drift is the launcher's value, not this one's,
//     which is why the compile-time guard lives in freertos_main.cpp.
//
// Out of scope for this fix: whether the controller pthread itself
// (priority 1, set in pthread.h) should be raised. pthread_create() there
// is a shared POSIX-compat shim, not specific to this transport, and
// repricing it is a separate change this file does not make.

// Review finding (Important 5): rpmsg_netif_get_stats() -- the glue's own
// rx-drop counters plus the frozen core tx/rx counters -- had no caller

// throttle, and only when at least one counter has actually moved since the

// port uses ends in rpmsg_virtio_wait_remote_ready(): a loop polling the
// shared vdev status byte until the Linux-side rpmsg-eth driver sets
// VIRTIO_CONFIG_STATUS_DRIVER_OK, with no timeout and no progress output of
// its own. Whatever task calls rpmsg_transport_init() (configure_network()
// -> lwip_bring_up_blocking()) therefore sits in that loop for as long as
// Linux takes to bind. Without an independent, higher-priority task that
// blocks on a real timer, a board session has no way to tell "still waiting
// for Linux to bind" from "hung" -- both look like silence on the console.
//
// CORRECTED (the premise the rest of this comment used to rest on): it
// previously stated that the caller runs "on actuation_task, priority
// configMAX_PRIORITIES - 2 == 30", and that "nothing else in this image is
// registered above priority 30 except this heartbeat task". The caller is
// still actuation_task, but it now runs at ACTUATION_TASK_PRIORITY (== 2,
// see freertos_main.cpp) -- that 30 was the starvation defect, not a fact to
// build on -- so both statements are stale. Two things are worth recording
// rather than just renumbering:
//
//   - The wait's only concession to other tasks is metal_yield(), and on
//     this build that is libmetal's `generic` processor backend, where
//     metal_cpu_yield() expands to nothing at all (the fetched libmetal has
//     no arm/ variant, so lib/processor/generic/cpu.h is what gets
//     installed). It is a pure busy spin -- not even a taskYIELD(). No
//     choice of caller priority makes it hand the CPU over voluntarily.
//   - Which is precisely why this task's mechanism still holds, and why its
//     priority must NOT be lowered to track the caller's. It runs because
//     (a) it sits at configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1 (31), above every other task
//     in the image, the spinning caller included, and (b) it blocks in
//     vTaskDelay() -- a real tick-driven wait serviced by the tick
//     interrupt, not a busy-yield that depends on the spinner cooperating.
//     A task at or below the caller's priority would still be invisible for
//     the whole spin; this one is not.
//
// RPMSG_VDEV_HEARTBEAT_PRIORITY therefore stays at 31 and only its
// justification changes: the requirement is "above everything in the image",
// and with the launcher down at 2 that margin is wider than before, not
// narrower. The task is deleted the moment platform_create_rpmsg_vdev()
// returns (success or failure); it does not bound the wait itself (the
// vendor call still has no timeout), it only makes the wait observable.
//
// One real behaviour change the lower caller priority introduces, recorded
// here because this is the only place the wait is documented: at 30 the spin
// froze every task below it, so the tcpip thread (4) and the FreeRTOS timer
// service (3) made no progress for its whole duration. At 2 both can now
// preempt it -- preemption is priority-driven here (configUSE_PREEMPTION 1)
// and does not need the spinning task to yield. That is harmless at this
// point in the sequence: rpmsg_poll_task does not exist yet (it is created
// further down, after the endpoint), no CycloneDDS thread exists yet (the
// Controller is constructed later), no netif has been added yet, and the
// caller holds no lwIP core lock here -- lwip_bringup.c takes
// LOCK_TCPIP_CORE() only after rpmsg_transport_init() has returned -- so the
// tcpip thread waking on its own cyclic-timer schedule has nothing to
// contend with it for.

// "Above everything in the image" is a stronger claim than the one it
// replaced, and this file's whole lesson is that a strengthened claim left
// as prose is how the last one survived. So assert the half that is
// checkable from here: this task must outrank the highest-priority task the

// assertions hold the other end, pinning the launcher -- and with it the
