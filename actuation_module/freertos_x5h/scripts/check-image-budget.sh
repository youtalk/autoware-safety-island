# Asserts the firmware fits the frozen Core1 boot-slot memory budget: every
# LOAD segment's MemSiz must fall entirely inside either the 10 MiB Core1
# slot window (0x11600000-0x12000000) or the firmware-loadable subregion of
# the resource-table carveout (0x96650000-0x96651000 -- see
# check-elf-contract.sh's "Carveout" comment for why that subregion, not the
# full carveout, is the firmware's to use). Reports the slot window's used
# bytes and percentage on success.
#
# This is the spec's memory-risk gate for Task 4 (lwIP + CycloneDDS +
# actuation module full link): if this ever prints BUDGET_FAIL, the fix is
# to shrink lwIP/CycloneDDS static pools, NOT to move the resource table,
# grow the slot window, or edit this script.
#
# The task brief's own draft of this script uses awk's strtonum() to parse
# the hex VirtAddr/MemSiz fields from `readelf -lW`. strtonum() is a gawk
# extension; the default `awk` on this system is mawk, where it is
# undefined -- confirmed by running `awk 'BEGIN{print strtonum("10")}'`,
# which errors with "calling undefined function strtonum". This script
# follows check-elf-contract.sh's already-established fix for the same
# problem: do all hex arithmetic in bash's own $((16#...)) instead of in awk.
#
# Pipe-and-early-exit hazard: same as check-elf-contract.sh. Every readelf
# invocation here is either captured into a variable before being matched,
# or (the LOAD-segment loop below) piped only into an awk whose action never
# exits early -- so there is no live readelf writer left for a downstream
# early-quitting consumer to SIGPIPE under `set -o pipefail`.
#
# Usage: check-image-budget.sh <elf>
# Exit 0 iff every LOAD segment fits its region (prints BUDGET_PASS <elf>).
# Exit 1 with "BUDGET_FAIL: <reason>" on stderr otherwise.
