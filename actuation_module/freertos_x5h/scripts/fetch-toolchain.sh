# Downloads and unpacks the pinned Arm GNU 13.2.Rel1 arm-none-eabi toolchain
# into build/toolchain/ (idempotent: a re-run with a valid extracted toolchain
# already in place skips the download). Prints the bin/ path on stdout so
# callers can do `PATH="$(fetch-toolchain.sh):$PATH"`.
#
# Network note: this hits a public Arm developer.arm.com URL that 302-redirects
# to an Azure blob (~179 MB). Network access is required to run this script.
#
# Safety: this artifact becomes board-flashed firmware's build toolchain, so
# the downloaded tarball is verified against a pinned sha256 before it is
# ever extracted (TARBALL_SHA256 below, computed once from a verified
# download of TARBALL_URL and frozen here). The download and extraction
# happen in a private temp directory that is only `mv`'d into its final
# location (BIN's parent) after both the checksum and the extracted
# toolchain's --version output have been verified -- so a run that is
# interrupted midway (killed, network drop, disk full) can never leave a
# partial toolchain tree sitting at the final path that would then
# incorrectly satisfy the `[ -x "$BIN/arm-none-eabi-gcc" ]` idempotency guard
# on the next invocation.
