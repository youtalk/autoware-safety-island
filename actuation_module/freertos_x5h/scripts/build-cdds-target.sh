# Run on the development host. Ported from
# actuation_module/freertos_s32z2/scripts/build-cdds-target.sh, with two
# deliberate differences:
#   - No NXP RTD/S32 Config Tools env vars: every input here (FreeRTOS
#     kernel, CR52 port, lwIP, our lwip_port) is either a public git
#     submodule under actuation_module/freertos_x5h/ or a file we wrote
#     ourselves, so there is nothing to point at via environment variables.
#   - -mfloat-abi=softfp, not S32Z2's -mfloat-abi=hard -- matches the R-Car
#     BSP's own inherited ABI (see cmake/arm-cortex-r52-x5h.cmake's header
#     comment).

# -mfloat-abi=softfp, LWIP_TIMEVAL_PRIVATE=0 (same newlib struct timeval
# collision as S32Z2's identical fix), and the four include paths CycloneDDS's
# WITH_FREERTOS/WITH_LWIP backends need: our lwip_port (arch/cc.h,
# arch/sys_arch.h, lwipopts.h), lwip's own public headers, the FreeRTOS
# kernel, and the R-Car CR52 demo's include/ (FreeRTOSConfig.h + portmacro.h
# -- see ddsrt/src/threads/freertos/threads.c's #include <FreeRTOS.h> /
# #include <task.h>, which resolve through these four paths).
#
# -D__int64_t_defined=1 -include inttypes.h -include sys/select.h:
# identical fix to S32Z2's own build-cdds-target.sh (same newlib toolchain
# family, same problems -- confirmed this is a plain newlib quirk, not
# something specific to S32Z2's NXP RTD headers: this vanilla Arm GNU
# 13.2.Rel1 toolchain's own <inttypes.h> gates PRId64/PRIu64/etc. behind
# `#if __int64_t_defined`, and under -ffreestanding that macro is not set by
# the time <inttypes.h> is preprocessed even after <stdint.h> has already
# defined int64_t -- confirmed with a standalone repro before adding this
# flag here). inttypes.h: ddsrt/src/core/cdr/src/dds_cdrstream.c and
# ddsi/src/ddsi_portmapping.c use PRIu64 without including it themselves
# (relies on some other header pulling it in transitively on a hosted libc
# -- not guaranteed on newlib). sys/select.h:
# forces newlib's own fd_set/FD_SET to be defined before lwip/sockets.h is
# ever reached, so lwip/sockets.h's own `#ifndef FD_SET` guard skips its
# conflicting typedef instead of redefining `struct fd_set` a second time.
#
# -include lwip_port/cdds_multicast_compat.h: see that file's own header
# comment -- ddsi_udp.c references IP_MULTICAST_*/IP_*_MEMBERSHIP/
# struct ip_mreq unconditionally, which our LWIP_IGMP=0 config does not
# provide.
#
# -include lwip_port/cdds_freertos_compat.h: see that file's own header
# comment -- ddsrt/src/threads/freertos/threads.c calls xTaskCreateFpu(),
# an NXP-RTD-specific FreeRTOS API this R-Car BSP port does not have.
# CORRECTED (review finding, Important): a previous revision of this comment
# claimed the R-Car port's FPU context is "saved/restored unconditionally on
# every context switch" and therefore needs no such call -- that was false.
# common/ARM_CR52/port.c's FPU-context behaviour is controlled by
# configUSE_TASK_FPU_SUPPORT, which CMakeLists.txt explicitly forces to =2 on
# the freertos_bsp target (see that file's "FPU context for every task"
# section); it is that =2 setting, not some port-wide unconditional
# save/restore, that makes plain xTaskCreate() (aliased to xTaskCreateFpu()
# here) a safe, complete replacement. This flag is load-bearing: if
# configUSE_TASK_FPU_SUPPORT ever regressed back to its default of 1
# (lazy, opt-in FPU context, requiring a vPortTaskUsesFPU() call nothing
# here makes), this alias alone would no longer be correct.
